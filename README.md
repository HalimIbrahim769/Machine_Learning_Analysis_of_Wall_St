# Machine_Learning_Analysis_of_Wall_St

 WARNING: CURRENT PROGRAM USES CPU EXCLUSIVELY
 this is due to the fact that I do not own a GPU



 *Tickers.txt is a text file with all the stocks on the NASDAQ*

 I create a Machine Learning model that analyzes the stock market from historical data
 To do this I will use historical stock market data from yahoo finance's library

 from there I will split the data into training and testing and the model will effectively be able to predict the stock price of any ticker (this is effectively backtesting)

 I will attempt to produce 100% accuracy

 Then the model will be tested on real time data

 Finally, the model will be analyzed and evaluated against the S&P 500 and other benchmarks!

 POST REMARKS: Currently the model performs extremely well with an R2 score of 99%.fvfvf
